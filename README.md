# Constellation Test

Running the project:

1: `yarn or npm install `

2: `yarn dev or npm run dev `

Improvements to go live:

- Implement filter sharing using query params.
- Saving on local storage what user type on value input on a object separated by fields containing an array with last 100 entries to use as suggestion while user is searching. (Can be used with [MUI Auto Complete](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/))
- Use Next.JS to create a static page that can be scanned by SEO mechanisms.
- Add an authentication feature to be able to fetch JSON files behind an authenticated environment.
- If data would be on a very high amount, would create a backend to deal with pagination and use React Query to cache data.
- Dark theme.
- Import alias.
- Zustand to control the context with a simple way.
- Progress bar below the URL input in order to have feedback while fetching the JSON data.

Additional features:

- Error Icon which shows errors on hover. (Tooltip)
- Toast when occurs an error.
- Reset Button.
